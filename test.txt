1.(1) Lessons at school can provide children with valuable insights into being good members of society. This is due to the fact that in class, students can receive lessons about different traits of a truly good person that society needs, and then they put what they learn into practice by creating real-life problems and solving them together.
Example:
For example, during a lesson on kindness, students may be asked to role-play a situation where they help a friend who is feeling sad. This activity helps them understand the importance of empathy




2.2) Creative subjects have the same importance as other school courses in primary school because it allows students to find out their potential talents early on. In other words, school-age is the most convenient time for students to learn more about their interests by trying different activities as they are young enough to pursue their hobbies. They will probably not have any other chance later in their lives to discover that because they will be busy with difficult exams when they get older.
Example: 
For instance, outdoor practical activities, such as painting natural landscapes or exploring their surroundings, can encourage students to view life from multiple aspects






(3) Music, art and drama subjects help students to boost their confidence.This is because of the fact that creative lessons teach students how to perform in front of lots of people and give them a chance to socialise with other students. As a result, students can realise their real potential and act more confidently. 
Example:
For instance, role-play activities can help students learn to be confident when dealing with large crowds






One of the benefits of early childhood education/ pre-school education (giáo dục mầm non) is that it fosters social skills.
This is mainly that  => of the fact that early education promotes social skills by encouraging children to engage in group activities, where they learn to share, and communicate effectively with their classmates => peers. Moreover, through interaction with classmates and teachers, pre-school education helps children understand social issues such as respecting others. => children can be taught about moral lessons such as respecting others, which play a crucial in shaping their later personaility. 
For instance, during a role-play lesson, children cannot only improve their ability to communicate confidently but they can also gain a basic understanding of social skills like empathy by steping into  other shoes. As a result, children develop strong social skills from an early age, which become the factors for building good relationships later in life.




One of the reasons for the rise in homelessness is the shortage of affordable housing. In other words, that they struggle to afford rent, utilities, and basic necessary => NEEDS nesseary becomes insurmountable. This is mainly of the fact that the shortage of affordable housing makes it difficult for many people to find a place to live, leading them to become homeless. , in addition, with the rising of housing prices and rents, low-income individuals are unable to afford a home, forcing them to live on the streets
For example, in many large cities, rent prices have gone up, while wages have not increased enough for people to afford 




SUMMARY 
Language is a unique human ability that helps us share ideas and knowledge. With 7,000 languages, each shapes how we think and perceive the world. It influences how we understand space, time, numbers, and even colors. Language also affects memory 
and how we assign blame. Different grammatical structures also shape our thoughts. However, many languages are vanishing. Losing this variation limits our understanding of human thinking.








đề 2:
One of the reasons for the rise in homelessness is the shortage of affordable housing.This is mainly the fact that housing prices increase, low income families struggle to pay rent, leading to eliminations. More and more buildings grew up, leading to lack of land for houses.  For instance, in cities with high demand, rents often become unaffordable for low wage workers, this forces many to live on the streets . Without stable housing, it becomes harder for them to find jobs or improve their situation, creating a circle of poverty. Solving this issue requires increasing the availability of affordable housing.




đề 3:
One of the challenges in addressing gender inequality is cultural norms that restrict women's roles in society.
In other words, cultural norms are beliefs that, in the past, suggested that men should be treated better than women, especially in Asia.
This is mainly due to the fact that several people who hold cultural norms are elders, and they can affect adolescents through teaching them, which leads to a wrong mindset about the value of women.
Moreover, in an extended family, interaction between a person with cultural norms and other members not only makes family members feel annoyed but also reflects that discrimination still exists.
For instance, in Asia, when elders with the cultural norms mindset tell stories about the past to children, they can give the children a wrong perception about women.
These issues have a bad effect on society, increasing gender inequality. Women can lose their interest and opportunities.








Additionally, studying abroad can lead to culture shock, in other words, culture shock refers to the confusion and discomfort  when exposed to a new culture that is  different from their home. There is no doubt that adapting to unfamiliar languages, and society can be an overload  for many students. For instance, when VietNamese students abroad to western, they would be surprised because, western residents tend to open gift in front of giving person. While the opposite trend is true for Vietnamese people, especially VietNamese students.
As a result, they may feel isolated, stressed, which can negatively affect their academic performance.






double idea paragraph 


International tourism has brought enormous benefits to many places.First and foremost, attracting foreign visitors would promote the image of the country, culture and people of this place to the world. This is mainly because international tourism goes to destination places, after that they would post on social media.moreover, there is no denying that tourism can promote local economy. This is mainly because local people can generate income through selling a wide range of products and services. As a result, this not only enhances their living standard but  also promotes entrepreneurship.  Which leads to significant increases in the native people’s wages. For instance, many people became wealthier and famer after receiving overseas tourism in VietNam.




2.International tourism has negative impacts on local inhabitants and the environment. Firstly, receiving overseas tourism may lead to many bad effects on culture and society .This is because tourists often disrupt traditional customs and local life styles, their behaviours and expectations may not be suitable with the local culture and the pressure on resources and infrastructure can lead to higher living costs, it is clearly that increasing number of tourists raise the demand for local goods and services which drives prices up. Additionally, the rapid growth of foreign visitors could damage the ecosystem balance. It  is indisputable that popular tourist destinations tend to over exploit natural resources, resulting in vanishing shelter of some species leading to loss of biodiversity . For example, in VietNam, the increase of hotels, resorts has led to the loss of habitats of many species, leading to their extinction.




3. Staying in the same job exerts many positive influences on workers. First and foremost, staying in the same jobs provides workers with  a stable job. This is because  staying in the same jobs allows them to build a solid job, plan for the future and avoid stress which often comes from changing jobs. Moreover, there is no denying that having a stable job can develop worker's skills and career. As they have the opportunity to gain more knowledge and experience while staying in the occupations. For example, an employee working as a cybersecurity in the same company for several years can become competent in the operation company server and prevent network attacks such as ddos,sql injection.

It is proposed that most scientists believe that eating fast food is harmful to health. While there are those who contend that the key to solving this issue is education, other people voice that it does not work. In my opinion, I agree with the former argument because education can raise awareness about the risks of eating junk foods and encourage healthier lifestyles.


On the one hand, it is reasonable for some people to think => CONTEND that education alone may not be effective in solving this problem. This is mainly because some people tend to think that the effect of eating high-processed food is not likely to be  relevant to education.[why not relevant?] As a result, the consumption of junk food would dramatically increase and lead to a significant raise in the body fat percentage over the world (biện pháp ko hiệu quả đâu nhât thiết phải làm vđề trầm trọng thêm?, result ko hợp lí). For instance, in many  developed countries where education about healthy eating is widely arranged => provided (education ko đi với arrange) , the consumption of processed foods continues to rise.




On the other hand, education is thought to be a crucial factor in addressing this issue. It is undeniable that awareness about the effects of eating fast food may be raised by education => dùng câu chủ động: it can raise people’s awareness….. If people understood the negative effects => impacts/ consequences of consuming highly processed foods, they would avoid them. Therefore, they would have a healthier lifestyle and this could lead to a decrease in the prevalence of related diseases such as obesity, stroke. For example, many schools have already apply teaching about health problems including the effect of fast food => have already integrated programmes teaching about health problems associated with unhealthy eating into school curriculums, which and these programs has ve proven to be effective (how effective, provide figures, for example: kể từ khi kết hợp dạy thì số lượng giảm bnhieu %.... ). =>>> Reasoning is not really compelling as you use the same reasons for body 1 + 2, you should talk about any aspects of education but raise awareness (as you use it in body 1)


To recapitulate, although there are rationales to say that education alone may not be the solution to the problem of eating processed food, it is my strong belief that education plays a vital role in addressing this issue as people could have a right perception about fast food and it literally aims for the long-run betterment.

On the one hand, it is reasonable for some people to contend that education alone may not be effective in solving this problem. This is mainly because the impact of eating highly processed foods is not only linked to => associated with educational awareness but also its low cost and convenience => clarify “low cost” “ convenience” . For instance, in many  developed countries where education about healthy eating is widely available , the consumption of processed foods continues to rise despite these efforts.




On the other hand, education is thought to be a crucial factor in addressing this issue. First and foremost, education can raise people’s awareness about eating junk foods . If people understood the consequences of consuming highly processed foods, they would avoid them. Therefore, they would have a healthier lifestyle and this could lead to a decrease in the prevalence => number of related diseases such as obesity and, stroke. For example, many schools have already integrated programmes teaching about health problems associated with unhealthy eating into school curriculums, which programs have proven to be effective. For instance, one study shows that schools implementing nutrition education programs saw a 50% reduction in the consumption of snacks and other junk foods. Additionally, education can provide individual skills and knowledge needed to make healthier food choices. This is because education teaches people how to read nutrition labels, identify unhealthy ingredients and plan meals.




To recapitulate, although there are rationales to say that education alone may not be the solution to the problem of eating processed food, it is my strong belief that education plays a vital role in addressing this issue as people could have a right perception about fast food and it literally aims for the long-run betterment.


While there are those who contend that physical appearance should be given more priority at work, other people voice that the quality of work is more significant . From my perspective, I agree with the latter argument for a number of reasons.


TOPIC ST 1:
On the one hand, it is reasonable for some people to argue that physical appearance should be considered more important in the workplace.


TOPIC ST 2:
On the other hand, quality of work is thought to be crucial in the workplace rather than stunning appearance.


On the one hand, it is reasonable for some people to argue that physical appearance should be considered more important in the workplace. This is because a good physical appearance can helps create a positive first impression => leave first positive impression AS, people tend to respect those who dress in  a FORMAL way that shows respect for them. As a result, employees can build positive relationships with partners => COLLEAGUES and create a peaceful atmosphere in the workplace or social platforms => NOT REALLY. For instance, when everyone in the team dresses smartly, it helps them treat others with more respect, leading to better communication and teamwork.






It is proposed that people are now choosing to share their individual data with technology companies  for gaining access to various software.
Although this phenomenon can result in certain drawbacks, I contend that its positive aspects significantly surpass any company's negative aspects.




On the one hand, this trend is thought to bring about some drawbacks.


On the other hand, sharing individual data with technology companies for gaining access to various software is thought to be beneficial. The positive feature is that people would have permission to access more company’s services due to rising user experience.

While there are those who contend that young people should conform to social norms, others voice that they should be allowed to express their individuality. In my opinion, I agree with the latter argument. 


On the one hand, it is reasonable for some people to believe that young people should preserve long-standing social customs and practices. First  and foremost,young people can contribute to maintaining a country’s cultural values by keeping old customs alive through generations. As a result , they would have a sense of belonging and pride in their cultural identity and help people more deeply connected to their heritage.Moreover, following a traditional lifestyle could bridge the generation gaps within families. This is mainly because // adhering to traditional values allows young people to find common ground with their older family members.Therefore, not only adolescents are not only easier to understand but also appreciate the previous generations’ way of life, reducing  conflicts relating to lifestyles and views.(S+V, ViIng)




PLAYING GAMES IS FUN 
PLAY GAMES ARE FUN XXXXXXX
Not only I, but my cousins // also love Tet 
I not only like him, but also like his family. 


On the other hand, embracing individuality is thought to be more advantageous. The first advantage is that following one's own lifestyle allows young people to maximize their potential and gives them more freedom to develop their talents which leads to creativity and innovation. Another advantage is that living authentically makes people more confident, comfortable and motivate.When people live with true values, they would feel comfortable because they do not have to conform other’s expectations leads to greater confidence as they do not need to hire their true self or pretend someone else.For example, someone who loves music become musician insteads of traditional office.


To recapitulate, although there are rationales to say that young people should conform to social norms it is my strong belief that the benefits of following a free lifestyle prevail over any given advantages as people would become more independent, comfortable and creative.

While there are those who contend that a job brings both salary and social relationships  , others voice that it is better to build up a social life with people who they do not work with. In my opinion, I agree with the former argument. ok


On the one hand, it is reasonable for some people to believe that developing a social connection with people you do  not work with is better. First and foremost, it => it không thay thế cho cái gì đằng trước => having a good relationship with colleagues gives us more perspective about lives. There is no denying that  people working in the same companies tend to share the mindsets that lead to more comprehension  similar points of view about life between members in the same company. Additionally, relationships developed outside of work tend to be more long-lasting. This is mainly because outside relationships are not affected by job changes or workplace tensions , and allows  => allowing individuals to maintain a clear boundary and avoid having to manage both friendship and work responsibilities with the same person.


On the other hand, a job is thought to provide both income and social life. This is mainly because   There is no denying that having relationships within members in a company enhances => can enhance work efficiency. This is mainly because, in the same company colleagues can gain a deeper understanding of each other’s strengths and weaknesses that lead to more effective teamwork and smoother workflow, thereby improving/ increasing/ boosting productivity and  improve work productivity. As a result,both employees and employers can benefit from that workplace productivity is increased, benefiting both employees and employers. For instance, in customer service jobs, workers who communicate well with each other can resolve customer issues more quickly and effectively.

12/2

Agree.

Disagree View:
+ Nowaday, computers and mobile phones are convenient for students to learn and also increase their reading and writing speed.
Reasons:
	Reading could be easier based on extensions in electronic devices. If students have assignments, they would be more competent in reading skills.
	Using electronic devices could save students time by typing rather than writing. In some cases, students who do not have good handwriting can type efficiently, making it easier for readers to understand writer' meanings.
	
Agree View:
+ Depending too much on computers and mobile phones could make young people lazier in handwriting.
Reasons:
	If typing is overused, handwriting may no longer be practiced in schools, making it more difficult. In real life, if students only have a pen and paper, they may not be able to write as quickly as they initialize.

+ Reading too much on screens prevents students from gaining a variety of perspectives in essays.

Reasons:
	screens have limited size, students must scroll down to read content. Even when dividing the screen into two sections, the font size becomes extremely small, making it difficult to focus on the text.



16/2


It is argued that an interview is not a valid approach to make the final recruitment ruling.In my opinion , I agree with this argument for some reasons.

Admittedly, one might argue that interviews can bring more benefits than drawbacks. This is predicated on the assumption that the recruiter could understand more about the candidates (dù là interview hay bài kiểm tra khác cũng có thể biết thêm về candidate mà, vậy cái gì ở đây khiến interview trở nên đặc biệt hơn so với các hình thức khác?) => recruiters can gain a better understanding of candidates through face-to-face interaction. This is mainly because through communication they could determine whether an applicant’s personal value aligns with the company’s one or working environment. However, this line of reasoning is not sound as the interview is not objective => sound as  the candidate could exaggerate about themselves.

I, therefore, would contend that the downsides of interviewing far outweigh its upsides. First and foremost, interviewing may not be objective. This is attributed to the fact that the interviewer's bias in favor of gender and religion can lead to unfair assessments. For instance, some regions do not have a standard accent, which could make the recruiter disappointed, leading to bad results and unfairness => For instance, applicants from regions with distinct accents may be perceived less favorably, despite having the necessary qualifications. Moreover, the recruiter has difficulty evaluating candidates' true values, On the basis that the interview's duration is extremely short, typically only 30-60 minutes. Therefore, they may not be able to conduct a comprehensive evaluation, leading to overlooking some  qualified candidates.

Some people think that the increasing use of computers and mobile phones for communication has a negative effect on young people’s reading and writing skills. To what extent do you agree or disagree?

1.
There are those who contend that the greater use of electronic devices such as computers and mobile phones for communication makes it harder for adolescents to develop reading and writing skills. I strongly agree with this view because excessive reliance on these devices can negatively affect handwriting and reading skills.


On the one hand, it is reasonable for some people to believe that using electronic devices can be convenient for developing reading and writing skills. This is because computers and mobile phones allow young people to read and write anywhere, eliminating the need for physical books and notebooks. For example, students can access e-books, online courses , and digital libraries at any time, making reading more flexible and convenient. Sometimes, students with poor handwriting can type instead, which makes it easier for others to understand what they mean.


On the other hand, computers and mobile phones are thought to have negative effects on reading and writing skills. For writing, using computers and mobile phones too much can make young people less interested in handwriting, which may make their handwriting hard to read. If students only have a pen and paper, they may not be able to write quickly because they do not practice often. For reading, looking at screens for a long time can hurt the eyes and make it harder to focus. When students feel tired from looking at a screen, they may not be able to read carefully, which can make it harder to understand what they are reading.


To recapitulate, although there are rationales to say that people  should use electronic devices to communicate, especially adolescents, it is my strong belief that using them too much could have a negative effect on young people  as they could fade handwriting and reading skills and  it literally aims for the long-run betterment. 


2.

It is proposed that some people believe that the spread of English as a global language has more benefits than drawbacks. In my opinion,I totally agree with this argument for some reasons. 


The first reason is that English makes global communication easier. This is mainly because English is used as a common language in many fields, such as education and travel. It is obvious that when people from different countries speak the same language, they can understand each other better. For example, most international meetings and even websites are in English, allowing people to share their ideas and knowledge more easily.

The second reason is that English can enhance job and educational opportunities. There is no denying that many prestigious universities require English skills, which means that people who master the language have better chances for their careers and education. For example, in Vietnam, people with good English skills can enter top universities that require a high level of foreign language skills, such as NEU and FTU. In addition, many international companies prefer employees who can speak English because it helps them work with foreign clients and partners.

To conclude, I strongly believe that English becoming a global language has more advantages than disadvantages because it helps people communicate better and provides them with better job and education opportunities.

Some people say that the best way to improve public health is by increasing the number of sports facilities. To what extent do you agree or disagree?


It is proposed that the best solution to boost community physical health is based on rising => is to raise (not rise, rising means increasing) sports facilities quantities.In my opinion, I disagree with this argument for some underlying reasons.




Granted, it is reasonable for some people to argue that improving public health by increasing the quantity of sports facilities. This is predicated on the assumption that it would encourage physical activities among people, especially people who lack motivation. If more gyms and parks existed => allowed people to join without charge, individuals could have opportunities to engage in good facilities => more physical exercise => You can rewrite the whole sentence like this: Free access to well-equipped gyms and parks would provide individuals with more opportunities to exercise, potentially reducing obesity and nutrition-related diseases. Moreover, this could reduce overweightness and some diseases associated with nutrition (not relevant if standing alone as this paragraph only refers to physical activities, not nutrition. you can try to make it as a consequence of doing exercise as suggested above). However, this line of reasoning is not sound because without increasing sports facilities, public health also improves by raising their awareness => However, this approach is not entirely effective, as public health is influenced by multiple factors, not just physical activity.






On the other hand, the key to solving this issue is raising people's awareness, especially adolescents => young people. This is mainly because when people become more aware of health problems, they would be more active to care for their bodies => are more likely to be responsible for their well-being rather than relying on external factors like sports facilities. Additionally, adolescents are AT a crucial stage of body development. If they were right-educated about healthy lifestyles, they would absorb => DEVELOP good habits and avoid harmful daily routines => GET RID OF UNHEALTHY ONES such as smoking or eating junk food.






To recapitulate, it is a mistake to assume that increasing sports facilities is the best way to improve community health because the key to solving these issues is raising people's awareness.
GOOD CONCLUSION

In education and employment, some people work harder than others. Why do some people work harder? Is it always a good thing to work hard?


It is  proposed that in working environments such as education and employment, some people tend to work more diligently than OTHERS counterparts (COUNTERPART được dùng để so sánh 2 khái niệm tương quan, vdu man and women, so it is not used there). There are some underlying reasons for this and I contend that it is not always good to work industriously.




There are several reasons for people’s motivation which boosts them to why some people work harder than others. Chief of these is that they want to gain a good position in society =>they have ambition to achieve a higher social and financial status. There is predicted on the assumption that having good standing in society ,in other words, they would have a high income and buy luxury items (chỉ chọn in other words/There is predicted on the assumption that, trong th này dùng assumption vì đang gthich nhé) => There is predicted on the assumption that professional success brings financial rewards, which allow them to afford a luxurious lifestyle . For instance, Elon Musk has worked extremely hard => has worked tirelessly to build up companies like Tesla and SpaceX. Because of his success, he has earned a huge amount of money and can afford luxury items such as expensive houses and even a social media company , Twitter.


However, I strongly believe that it is not good to always work hard. The first reason is that companies may exploit hardworking employees by assigning them excessive workloads, leading to burnout. Moreover, maintaining  constant high => intensive mental performance could lead to a risk of mental health => have severe consequences on mental health. For instance,  (a study ko cần for instance) a study published in Social Science & Medicine shows that individuals who work more than 39 hours per week have a higher risk of developing neurological issues = disorders.




In conclusion,  although employees may gain a huge amount of benefits from working industriously, I strongly believe that it is not always good to work hard.

It is proposed that more and more people migrate from the countryside to urban areas.Although this phenomenon is attributed to several reasons, some steps can be taken to address  this issue. 


There are two main issues resulting from this problem.
One of these is the arising of economic chaos=>  the disruption of economic stability, particularly in rural regions. If more and more people migrated from rural areas to cities, it would lead to a labor shortage and cause some rural regions that used to be the main industry to decline =>, ,leading to the decline of industries that traditionally relied on rural workers, such as agriculture and craftsmanship (S+v, ving). Another issue is population overload (không có cụm này nha) => overpopulation in urban areas. This is due to the fact that when too many people converge in one city, it can lead to overcrowding (k cần giải thích nữa, ndung này đã nói câu trước rồi). More seriously, it may result in shortages of housing and infrastructure. According to the General Statistics Office of VietNam (GSO), in 2023, There was a significant increase of approximately 3.4% in the urban population, with nearly 70% of this growth being attributed to the rural-to-urban migration coming from migrants . In 2022, in HaNoi and HCM city, 30-40% of the migrated people lived in temporary houses (reported by the Ministry of Construction of VietNam) => Furthermore, a report from the Ministry of Construction of Vietnam revealed that in 2022, between 30% and 40% of migrants in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City lived in temporary or substandard housing.


To cope with the above issue, there are two viable solutions that could be taken into consideration. The first possible measure would be to raise people's awareness about the balanced population distribution. This is supported by the fact that people would stay in rural areas if they knew about the negative effect caused by unbalanced population distribution => đảo vế if lên đầu cho nhấn mạnh câu nhen, chị wording lại câu nhé: If rural residents were more informed about the adverse consequences of excessive urban migration, they might be more inclined to remain in their hometowns.

It is proposed that there has been an increase of approximately 20% in the proportion of obese children in Western communities over the last 10 years. This trend is attributed to several factors, and a number of detrimental effects associated with it will be discussed in this essay.
good! no grammatical errors


There are two underlying reasons for this trend. The main cause of this problem is that there is a => the lack of awareness  or education about nutrition from both children and their parents. In other words, in schools, children may not be taught => educated about the negative effects of junk food, and parents may not be able to restrict them from consuming unhealthy foods. Another reason is that there is an increasing number of compelling advertisements for junk food, which attract children to buy them. This is due to the fact that children are attracted to bright colors and items which they have never seen before => junk food companies strategically use bright colors, appealing mascots, and engaging messages to attract young consumers. For instance, junk food advertising in America often includes strong colors like red and yellow to capture children's attention.


There are two primary consequences that should be taken into consideration. First and foremost,  the first feasible impact is that obese children are more prone to diseases such as heart problems. This is supported by the fact that a high input of carbohydrates from unhealthy foods can lead to blocked blood flow to the heart. Another possible consequence is being bullied by friends. This is supported by the fact that children with unusual body shapes => different physical apperance may be criticized => body shamed (chỉ trích?)  by their peers friends or society, leading to mental health issues and difficulties in build up social relationshipsn=> Overweight children are often subjected to bullying and social exclusion, which can lead to low self-esteem, anxiety, and depression.


In conclusion, this problem is attributable to the lack of education about nutrition and the rise in junk food advertising, and its damaging effects are heart issues (hear issue chỉ là 1 ví dụ nhỏ thui mà) severe health problems  and social bullying => social stigma/ public stigma.

It is proposed that more and more people migrate from the countryside to urban areas.Although this phenomenon is attributed to several reasons, some steps can be taken to address  this issue. 




There are two main issues resulting from this problem.
One of these is the disruption of economic stability, particularly in rural regions. If more and more people migrated from rural areas to cities,leading to the decline of industries that traditionally relied on rural workers, such as agriculture and craftsmanship. Another issue is overpopulation in urban areas. More seriously, it may result in shortages of housing and infrastructure. Furthermore, a report from the Ministry of Construction of Vietnam revealed that in 2022, between 30% and 40% of migrants in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City lived in temporary or substandard housing.

It is proposed that a lack of freshwater is only a problem in some regions; however, with the excessive consumption of freshwater, it has become a global issue that people must face.


Although this phenomenon is attributed to several reasons, some steps can be taken to address this issue.


There are two underlying reasons for this phenomenon. The main cause of this problem is the expansion of industrial areas. In other words, this trend leads to the overexploitation of freshwater, which is a main supply resource for production. Another reason is the increasing population. This is due to the fact that as more and more people exist on the earth, there is a significant number of consumers demanding high-quality water. For instance, parents may want to provide their babies with the best environment, so they would prefer freshwater over other sources.


To cope with the above issue, there are two viable solutions that could be taken into consideration. To address the first cause, a possible measure could be for the government to implement heavy taxes on companies or individuals that exploit overuse amounts of water.


To tackle the second issue, a feasible action could be to limit people's access to freshwater. For example, if a family has 4 or more members, they would receive only 8l of water per day for their daily activities.


In conclusion, an increasing population and the expansion of industries are the main causes of this problem, and the most appropriate solutions are to put some strong taxes on companies and individuals that overexploit water and to limit access to freshwater.

It is proposed that global traveling brings pros to both travelers and the destination countries. Although this phenomenon can result in certain drawbacks , I contend that its advantages significantly surpass any accompanying disadvantages.


On the one hand, this trend  is thought to bring about some disadvantages. One evident disadvantage of global traveling is that it can harm the environment. The growing number of tourists could lead to more trash, pollution, and damage to nature.For example, famous places like beaches and parks often suffer from littering and the destruction of wildlife or forest.


On the other hand, international traveling is thought to be advantageous. The positive feature is that these phenomena boost more and more foreign people to know about the destination country, which leads to diplomacy with other countries. Additionally, if more and more foreign people, the local residents could gain more money and have a stable income.


To recapitulate, although there are rationales to say that global traveling brings more drawbacks, it is my strong belief that the advantages of international traveling  prevail over any given upsides  as this phenomenon could boost countries' economies and enhance local residents' stable income.

The amount of waste production in the US started at 131 million tonnes in 1980, after which it experienced a slight increase to 151 million tonnes in 1990 before ending the period at 2000.
The amount of waste production in Portugal increased gradually, ending the period at 5 million tonnes in 1980.
Similar changes, but to a greater extent, can be seen in the figure for Poland, which slightly rose from 4 million tonnes to 6.6 million tonnes.
The figure for Korea saw the opposite changes , declining from 31 million to 19 million tonnes.
28 million tonnes (data) + were produced in Japan, with a consequence rose dramatically => with a dramatic rise to 53 million tonnes in 2000.
=> 
The amount of waste production in 1980 started at 0.6 million tonnes and rocketed to 5 million in 2000.










The percentage of “excellent” responses started at 5%, after it experienced a significant increase, reaching 28% in 2010. Similar changes, but to a greater extent, can be seen in the figure for “good” responses, which increased nearly threefold to 39%. It is obvious that the percentages “good” and “excellent” responses  were the lowest in 2005, however, they were the highest points in 2010, indicating that client services improved over five years and enhanced the overall customer experience. 

The percentage of people rating the client service as “poor” declined dramatically from 21% in 2005 to 12% in 2010, reflecting a significant improvement in customer satisfaction. The figures for “very poor” and “satisfactory” saw a similar downward trend, decreasing from 15% to 4% and from 45% to 17%, respectively. very good!











The given graph compares three varieties of emission sources in terms of the UK nation.


Overall,despite some fluctuations, there was an increase in the amount of carbon emission from gas, while the opposite trend can be seen for the figures for Oil and Coal.Additionally, the quantity of carbon emission from  Coal generated was the lowest. Additionally, the quantity of emission Coal generated was the highest in the first year, while emission from gas was the lowest, however, this trend was reversed in the final year.




From 1990 to 2000. The number of carbon emissions generated from Gas started at approximately 220 million tons, after which it experienced a significant increase to 300 million tons over 10 years. Opposite changes but to a lesser extent can be  seen in the figure for Coal, which  slightly declined from 300 million tons to 250 million tons.Meanwhile the figure for Oil fluctuated throughout the related timeframe.
In the last ten years. It is noticeable that the consumption of Gas remained stable, while the figures for the remaining fuels recorded changes. Carbon emissions generated from gas from 2000 to 2010 kept rising, reaching its highest peak at nearly 320 million tons in the last year.In contrast,The figures for Oil and Coal saw a significant decline to approximately 190 million tons.

Chart 2: The chart below shows numbers of incidents (sự cố) and injuries (tai nạn) per 100 million passenger miles travelled (PMT) by transportation type in 2002.


- highest: demand response 
- lowest: commuter rail 
- similarity: incidents > injuries


The bar chart gives information about how many incidents and injuries per 100 million PMT by vehicle type in 2002.

Overall, the number of incidents was always higher than the figure for injuries among vehicles. Additionally, the trend for both incidents and injuries was highest in demand response, while the opposite can be seen in commuter rail. ĐÃ CHỮA TRÊN LỚP, VẪN CHƯA CHỮA LẠI VÀO ĐÂY À?

The number of incidents and injuries in demand response was the highest, at 225 and 173 million PMT, respectively, while the opposite trend can be seen for commuter rail (WHILE KO ĐỨNG TÁCH RA DC THÀNH 1 CÂU, LẦN CUỐI NHẮC NHÉ QUÁ NHIỀU LẦN RỒI). It is noticeable that the number of incidents in commuter rail was only 3 million PMT higher than its counterpart, while other categories showed a significant difference.

In terms of incidents, the figures for light rail and buses were similar, both at 76 million PMT. However, the number of injuries on buses exceeded that of light rail vehicles, with respective figures of 66 million PMT and 39 million PMT. The number ofIncidents on heavy rail vehicles  was at 51 million PMT, which was 25 million PMT lower than the figures for light rail and buses. In terms of injuries, heavy rail had a similar number to light rail, at 35 million PMT.




The bar chart compares boys and girls in terms of joining various activities  in 2010 in VietNam.

Overall, it is obvious that boys always pay attention to outdoor activities or activities that require skills, while the opposite can be seen for girls, who prefer light activities or activities requiring good hand technique. Additionally, the percentage of boys joined in sports activities was the highest, while the opposite can be seen for art and craft fields. The figure for girls was the highest.

The proportion of boys participating in sports activities was the highest, at around 28%, followed by those going to the park at 25%. Both figures far exceeded the percentage of girls engaging in these activities, which was similarly nearly 13%. The proportion of boys who joined in DVD activities was around 17%, which was 2% higher than that of girls in the same field.

In terms of computer games, it is noticeable that both genders pay an equal attention to this field, with the figures for both girls and boys being similar, at 15%. About 17% of boys joined in books activities, compared to 10% in the figure for girls who joined the same field.The proportion of girls joining art and craft activities was the second highest at 25%, far exceeding the figure for boys in the same activity, which was the lowest point at around 7%.


It is proposed that in many schools and universities, males are attracted to the arts field and those counterparts choose science subjects. From my perspective I strongly believe that this tendency should be changed based on several reasons which will be discussed in this essay.

There are two underlying reasons for this tendency. The main cause of this problem is gender identity. This is mainly because genders can determine prototypical personality traits. For instance, in terms of biology, males with higher levels of testosterone than their counterparts tend to act more decisively and be more competitive,while girls with higher Estrogen ( the main female hormone ) were affected by emotions, empathy and creativity. Another reason is that people tend to follow stereotypes given by society. It is widely believed that boys should be strong and protect girls, so they tend to learn anything that makes them feel confident,males should follow technical and logical fields, while their counterparts are expected to pursue arts, leading to a difference in their career choices.
However,  I strongly believe that this trend could be eliminated.The main reason is that it could enhance gender equality and make society more and more better, as everyone has the opportunities to do whatever job they want without being restricted by social expectations.Moreover,each individuals, especially girls, could have opportunities for jobs that used to be labeled as only for boys. For example,previously, nursing and preschool teaching were seen as jobs for women, but nowadays, more and more men are joining these fields.


In conclusion, there are two underlying reasons for this tendency, gender identity and society. Although this phenomenon still exists, I strongly believe that society would be better if it were eliminated.


TASK 1:

The line chart gives information about how much US meat and poultry were consumed from 1955 to 2012.

Overall,despite some fluctuation in beef consumption, the consumption of turkey and pork remained stable, while the opposite trend can be seen for broilers consumption. Additionally, the figure for turkey was the lowest throughout the time-frame,whereas beef was the highest.

The figure for beef consumption started at approximately 58 pounds in 1995,after which it experienced a considerable rise to 90 pounds in  around 1977, before ending the period at the same figure as in the first year.Similar changes, but to greater extent, can be seen in the figure for Broilers consumption, which started at around 15 pounds, then increased significantly throughout the period to highest peak at 59 pounds.

it is noticeable that the consumption of turkey and pork did not fluctuate much,remaining stable throughout the period. Pork consumption started at 50 pounds, experienced slight fluctuation then returned to its initial level. This shows that pork was a famous meat in the US, staying at the safe figure (around 50 pounds). The figure for turkey saw a similar change with a greater extent, growing from nearly 5 pounds in 1961 to 10 pounds in the last year.

Task 2: In some countries, students pay their own college or university fees while in others, the government pays for them. Do you think the advantages that the government pays the money outweigh the disadvantages?

It is a proposal that, in terms of education, the authorities should pay tuition for students who work in their countries. Although this phenomenon can result in certain benefits, I contend that its disadvantages significantly surpass any accompanying disadvantages.
On the one hand, this tendency is thought to bring about some benefits. One evident pros is that all students have equal opportunities to access academic education, especially those from disadvantaged backgrounds. In other words, many top universities have high tuition, leading to students who have disadvantaged backgrounds not being able to apply. If the government paid tuition for them, they would no longer have to worry about fees, which used to be a barrier they had to face. As a result, this phenomenon could enhance social development as more and more citizens are educated. However, this line of reasoning is not sound because if the government paid tuition for students, it could lead to a lack of investment in other fields, causing a decline in the economy.
On the other hand, this trend is thought to be disadvantageous. The negative feature is that the economics of the country should be reduced. This is mainly because reducing  governments’ budgets in other sectors as exempting tuition fees requires a large budget, leading to the government imposing higher taxes on dwellers to fund the development of the nation. As a result, the country's inflation rate could increase and cause the economy to go downward.

To recapitulate, although there are rationales to say that this trend brings some benefits, it is my strong belief that the negative aspect of that tendency prevails over any given merits as the nation's economics should decline.

The given table gives information about the population ratio of males and per 100 females in six variety zones => regions in 1955 and 2005.


Overall, there was an increase in the male-to-female ratio in Africa and Asia, while the opposite trend can be seen for remaining regions. Additionally, the male-to-female ratio in Asia was the highest, whereas the figure for Europe was the lowest throughout the given time period-frame.


The male-to-female ratio in Africa started at 97.8 males per 100 females in 1955, after which it experienced a slight increase to 99.2 males per 100 females in 2005. In Europe, the ratio increased dramatically, beginning at the lowest point of 89.4 males per 100 females and rising to 92.8 males per 100 females. 


It is noticeable that there were more males than females in Asia in 1995 and 2005, and this ratio was consistently higher than that in the other regions. In Asia, 105.3 males per 100 females were recorded per 100 females in 1995, and this figure decreased to 104.9 in 2005. Similar changes, but to a greater extent, can be seen in the figure for North America which declined from 100.1 males per 100 females to 96.9 males per 100 females. The figure for South and Central America saw similar changes, decreasing by 2.5 from an initial value of 100 males per 100 females. => South and Central America are the only two regions that have the numbers of males equal to females in 1955, but these figures decreased slightly after half a century.

Task 2:
Some people think it is better for one single legal system throughout the world. Others say countries should have their own laws. Discuss both views and give your opinion.


While there are those who contend that it is better for one single rule system all over the world, others voice that each nation should have an individual legal system. In my opinion, I totally agree with the latter view.


On the one hand, it is reasonable for some people to argue that people would have many benefits from setting only one single legal system throughout the world. This is mainly because of strengthening trade and commerce as If there was only one legal system among the nations, traders  would no longer have the time to seek out others' principles, leading to easier and faster trades between nations. For example, the current president of America in 2025 implemented a heavy tax on Vietnam at around 46%. If all nations used a common rule, the proportion of the nations that put a heavy tax on their counterparts would be reduced.


On the other hand, each nation should have their own rules. There is no denying that the rule reflects the characteristics of the nation and validates the nation's position in the world. This is attributed to the fact that each country has different cultural and economic levels, so they would need rules that can be sustainable for their nations rather than common rules. Moreover, the authorities could alter laws that are flexible and adaptable. It is obvious that if laws contributed to their nations, they would not need to send proposals to high-ranking officials around the world to reach an agreement.


To recapitulate, although there are rationales to say that it is better to use a common rule among nations, it is my strong belief that each country should have its own individual rules as affected by cultural and economic factors, and it literally aims for the long-run betterment.


Task 1:



The line chart illustrates how many people paid a visit to a museum in the UK in the summer and winter of 2005. 

Overall, the number of visitors in these two seasons peaked at the same time of the day. However, there were consistently more visitors in the summer compared to the winter, and people did not visit the museum after 3 o’clock in the afternoon in winter.

from 9 to 12 o’ clock. The number of visitors that come in Summer starts at 0, after which it experienced a significant increase to its highest peak at  around 1400 peoples, similar changes but to a lesser extent, which grew from 0 to 600 peoples .

In the last timeframe. The opposite trend was true for both figures, which decreased dramatically from its highest peak to zero. It is noticeable that the number of visitors who visit the museum after 15 o’ clock in the winter is nearly 0.

Task 2:
In some countries,more people are choosing to live alone or in a small family rather than in an extended family. Do you think this is a positive or negative trend/ Do the advantages of this outweigh the disadvantages?


It is a proposal that some people decide to live alone or in a nuclear family rather than in a multigenerational family. Although this tendency can result in certain drawbacks, I contend that its advantages significantly surpass any accompanying disadvantages.
On the one hand, this tendency is thought to bring about some drawbacks. One evident con is the lack of support with domestic responsibilities. This is mainly because if there are large numbers in a family, they could support each other, especially when parents take care of children when they are very young. As a result, the pressure put on parents would be released, and their children would have good social skills, which developed from treating them with various ages. Add thêm 1 luận điểm nữa 
On the other hand, this trend is thought to be advantageous. The positive feature is that they would have more valuable time for doing what they want. This is attributed to the fact that when the number of members in a family is too large, whereas the socioeconomic status of a family is low, members must share a room together, leading to a reduction in private time. Additionally, the lack of members to take care of children would make them become more independent, which plays a very significant role in their adulthood. WHYYY “ thEY become more independent” ???
To recapitulate, although there are rationales to say that this trend brings some disadvantages, it is my strong belief that the positive aspect of that tendency prevails over any given merits, such as the private time they would receive and the improvement of children.


Some people think that good health is very important to every person, so medical service should not be run by profit-making companies. Do the advantages of private healthcare outweigh the disadvantages?


Some people believe that good health is extremely essential for everybody, so healthcare services should not be run for profit. Although this tendency can result in certain benefits, I contend that its disadvantages significantly surpass any accompanying advantages.
On the one hand, this tendency is thought to bring about some benefits. One evident pro is that hospitals could provide better healthcare services to patients. This is mainly because,ĐỌC KĨ NHẬN XÉT as more and more patients come to the hospital, they would have more budget to invest in infrastructure, which strongly attracts patients, making them feel safer. => private hospitals often have modern facilities, shorter waiting times, and more attentive care compared to overcrowded public institutions. Additionally, the economic state of the country also solidifies. This is attributed to the fact that if hospitals are run for profit, they would have more income, in other words, they would have to pay heavy taxes to the government, leading to economic growth.
On the other hand, this trend is thought to be disadvantageous. The negative feature is that phải có luận điểm đã nhé: profit-driven companies may prioritize income over patient welfare. .

One essential aspect of a perfect society is the loss of morals.
 -> Morals are a standard for everyone. It can calm people, helping them avoid instinctive actions and guiding them to have the right behavior.
 -> They are ready to act for the community, for the common good of the public.
 -> As a result, society builds stronger principles and achieves further development.
For example, when people lose moral standards, in some particular cases, they tend to pay in order to overcome difficult situations, which is especially serious in politics. If high‑ranking officials receive bribes,it could  lead to the underdevelopment of a country’s economy.

The table demonstrates how many people visited eight different countries in 2009 and 2010.
Overall, except for Hong Kong and France, there was an increase in the number of tourists to all countries given,with Germany witnessing the most significant rise. In addition, the number of people paying a visit to France was the highest, while that of Hong Kong was the lowest. 
The number of visitors in Turkey started at 33 million in 2009, after which it experienced a significant increase of 12 million for a year. The figure for China and Germany saw a dramatic change, which initialized at 22 million and 11 million in 2009 and reached to 34 million and 23 million, respectively.
Regarding popular destinations, It is noticeable that France was the most attractive nation in 2019 and 2020, which had 76 million visitors in both years. The figure for Hong Kong saw an opposite change, which stayed at the lowest point throughout the given time frame, declining from 10 million to 9 million. In terms of nations that less tourists chose as their destinations these figures saw a slight decline.




The line graph gives information about the changes in prices of two types of material, namely gasoline and oil, from January to August in 2024.
Overall, the prices of gasoline and oil both saw  similar fluctuations; however, the figure for gasoline was higher than that for => of oil throughout the given time frame. Additionally, the highest point belongs to gasoline, whereas the lowest point is oil reached at the same time.
The figure for gasoline started at 22000 vnd/liter in January, after which it experienced a significant increase to 2400 vnd/liter in February, which declined from nearly 24,000 vnd/liter to approximately 23,000 vnd/liter. Similar changes, but to a lesser extent, can be seen in the figure for diesel oil, which began at around 19000 vnd/liter, after which it experienced a dramatic rise to around 21000 vnd/liter and a slight decrease before reaching around 20500 vnd/liter.
It is noticeable that the prices of RON 95 gasoline most fluctuated in the latter period of time. From April to August, the figures for RON 95 gasoline and diesel oil increased significantly and reached its highest peak at around 2500 vnd/liter and 2100 vnd/liter. From Jun to Jul, the prices of RON 95 and oil saw a recovering slightly after decline to approximately 2100 vnd/liter and 1800 vnd/liter, respectively. 




In some countries,more people are choosing to live alone or in a small family rather than in an extended family. Do you think this is a positive or negative trend/ Do the advantages of this outweigh the disadvantages?


It is a proposal that some people decide to live alone or in a nuclear family rather than in a multigenerational family. Although this tendency can result in certain drawbacks, I contend that its advantages significantly surpass any accompanying disadvantages.
On the one hand, this tendency is thought to bring about some drawbacks. One evident is the lack of support with domestic responsibilities. This is mainly because if there are large numbers in a family, they could support each other, especially when parents take care of children when they are very young. As a result, the pressure put on parents would be released.Moreover,
On the other hand, this trend is thought to be advantageous. The positive feature is that they would have more valuable time for doing what they want. This is attributed to the fact that when the number of members in a family is too large, shared living spaces force members to coordinate every aspect of daily life, leaving no room for individual privacy,leading to a reduction in private time. Additionally, the lack of members to take care of children would make them become more independent, this is mainly because the lack of members forces children to learn self reliance early whether in completing homework, managing chores, or addressing problems., which plays a very significant role in their adulthood.
To recapitulate, although there are rationales to say that this trend brings some disadvantages, it is my strong belief that the positive aspect of that tendency prevails over any given merits, such as the private time they would receive and the improvement of children.

In terms of cinema ticket sales, it is obvious that the percentage of films is directly proportional to the percentage of tickets sold, except for the romance genre. Around 20% of cinema tickets sold in 1966 were for comedy, followed by drama, accounting for 15%, which has a lesser extent with the figure for that in 2000. The proportion of cinema ticket sales in 2000 reached the highest peak at around 23% in the comedy field. Additionally, the figure for tickets sold in 2000 was double that in 1996, which was around 3%. Whereas romance showed an opposite trend compared to other genres, with the percentage of tickets sold in 2000 lower than that in 1996.

The picture illustrates how coffee is generated and prepared for sale.
It is obvious that the process comprises eleven distinct stages, beginning with collecting the coffee beans from the coffee plans, and ending with packing coffee beans into jars.
At the beginning of the process, coffee beans are collected from coffee trees,and then they are dried under the sun, in order to get rid of water inside them. After being dried, the coffee beans are entered into a machine to be roasted. Before being ground into fine powder, they are rapidly cooled. Once the coffee beans are ground, they are mixed with the hot water. After that, the coffee beans are strained to remove the grounds.


The process continues with the mixture of coffee beans being freezed, and then they are ground. Before packing the coffee beans into jars, they are dried in a vacuum.

The picture illustrates how plastic bottles are recycled.
It is obvious that the process comprises nine distinct stages, beginning with collecting plastic bottles, and ending with generating end items.
At the beginning of the process, plastic bottles are collected and placed into recycling bins, and then they are transported to a recycling centre by trucks. Once the plastic bottles are delivered to the recycling centre, they are sorted to decide whether they can be recycled. After being sorted, they are compacted into blocks in order to save storage places and be easier for handling.
The process continues with crushing the plastic bottle blocks and washing them with water. Before pelles are heated to form raw material, they are produced by a machine when plastic bottle frags are entered. After being heated, they become raw material, and then processed to become final products.

The given table illustrates the proportion of working males and females  in distinct fields of employment in a particular nation in 1986, 1996 and 2006.
Overall, the percentage of employees in the education and banking field increased, while the opposite trend can be seen for the proportion of employees in the Manufacturing industry.Except for Catering, which had the proportion of men increased whereas the counterparts remain unchanged.Additionally, the figure for education in womans was the highest, whereas the figure for manufacturing industry was the lowest.
In terms of working men, the figure for catering started at 16% in 1986 and then remained unchanged at 22% in the next 4 years. The proportion of Banking and education saw a slight increase from 11% and  13% to 21% and 15%, respectively, while the opposite trend was true for the figure for Manufacturing Industry, which declined from 32% to 17%.
Concerning working women, it is noticeable that the percentage of women employees had a similar trend, but to a greater extent.From 1986 to 2006, the figure for working women in catering remained unchanged at 26%. In education, the percentage of women accounted for the highest rate throughout the period, which increased from 33% to 38%, followed by banking. In contrast, the figure for working women in the Manufacturing industry was the lowest, which decreased by 12%.


TASK 2:
Today more and more people are using mobile phones and computers. Thus, people are losing the ability to communicate face to face. To what extent do you agree or disagree?


It is proposed that nowadays, people tend to use more and more electronic devices such as phones and computers, leading to losing the ability to communicate in real life. From my perspective, I totally agree with the argument.


On the one hand, it is reasonable for some people to argue that more and more people using electronic devices would not erode communication skills. It is based on the assumption that technologies could enhance communication, as these could help people communicate more easily despite the geography barrier. Moreover, in meetings, people could do research immediately without disruption, making communication more efficient.


On the other hand, the development of technologies is thought to make them lose the ability to communicate direction. This is mainly because people lack social skills. This is attributed to the fact that when users rely on technologies, they would lack interaction with the outside world and have fewer opportunities to practice essential social skills like reading body language and handling difficult communication situations. Additionally, communication by technologies could reduce the attention of people, as talking on many devices could lead to distractions between online and real-life conversation. Affected by message, notification.


To recapitulate, although there are rationales to say that more and more clients tend to use phones and computers to communicate and would not lose the ability to communicate, it is my strong belief that technology plays a vital role in losing the ability to communicate face-to-face, as people could lose essential social skills and reduce attention, and it literally aims for the long-run betterment.




2.Today more people put personal and private information (address, telephone and plastic card numbers) online to do their daily activities such as banking, shopping, and socializing. Is this a positive or negative development? (Ngày 17/02/2024)


It is proposed that nowadays, individuals tend to give their personal and private information, such as addresses, telephone and plastic card numbers, online to use free services such as banking, shopping, and socializing. Although this tendency can result in certain benefits, I contend that it is a negative development.


On the one hand, this phenomenon is thought to be a positive development, one piece of evidence is that putting in personal and private information could enhance the user's experience. It is based on the assumption that social media could feed more relevant information with the user's preference based on their private information, such as hobbies or color. Moreover, it could create more jobs in the technology sector because with the increase of people using online services, more jobs relevant to this field are introduced.


On the other hand, this trend is thought to be a positive development. The positive feature is that sending individuals information on the internet could threaten personal information. This is mainly because when posting information on the internet, it would belong to an organization or a company, if security is not handled carefully, hackers could attack and steal important data. For instance, in 2019, a security vulnerability in Facebook's system was exploited, leading to a massive leak of user data. As a result, anyone who created a Facebook account before 2019 could have their personal information, such as email addresses or mobile phones, accessed by others, even if they hide those details .


To recapitulate, although there are rationales to say that this trend brings some benefits, it is my strong belief that the negative aspect of that tendency prevails over any given merits as the personal data is threatened.


Some people argue that individuals can do nothing to improve the environment. Therefore, only governments and large companies can make a difference. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?




It is inevitable that each individual contributes a lot to the environment, therefore some people would argue that only governments and large companies could make a difference. In my opinion, I disagree with this argument.


Granted, governments and huge companies could have a huge effect on the environment. Firstly, it is evident that the government is at a high-ranking level in a nation, they could implement some strict rules on people to a large effect. Secondly, in terms of huge companies, they have a significant influence among clients. For example, a huge company, Nestlé MILO, implemented a complaint that replaced plastic straws with paper straws in March 2020. According to the plan, the brand aimed to complete the conversion to using paper straws for at least 90% of its production by the end of 2021 and achieve 100% by May 2022.


However, individuals also have a large contribution to the improvement of the environment, as the more awareness people have, the more advantageous it is for the environment. Individuals can contribute to conserving the environment by changing their daily habits, such as switching to renewable energy or using environmentally friendly products. Moreover, by adopting green habits, consumers can force companies to implement activities that are not harmful to the environment, and they can boycott products whose production process contaminates the surroundings.


To recapitulate, it is my strong belief that individuals also have a huge effect on the improvement of the ecosystem.

The picture illustrates how a particular type of coal is used to generate electricity.


It is obvious that the process comprises eight distinct stages, beginning with extracting coal from the mine, and ending with delivering electricity to family and company.


At the beginning of the process, the coal is extracted from the mine, then the mined coal is piled up. After being piled up, it is put into a crusher, where it is ground into small pieces. Once being ground, the fine powder is transported by truck to a gasifier, where coal is burned from solid to liquid forms.


The process continues with the coal fine powder being cooled in a dedicated facility and releasing waste heat. Before being sent to an electricity plant, the substance undergoes a cleaning process.Once, being cleaned, in an electricity plant, the gas is converted into electricity and released waste heat. At the final stage, the electricity is ready for residential and industrial consumption.

The picture illustrates how paper is produced and recycled.


It is clear that the process comprises ten distinct stages. Beginning with the cut down process, And ending with the pulping process.


At the beginning of the process, trees are cut down, and then they are fed into a drum to remove hark. After the hark is removed, they are chopped into small pieces. Once the wood is converted into a small shape, it is refined into pulp by a specialized machine, and then rolled papers are used for printing newspapers.


The process continues with newspapers being collected for recycling. After that, collected papers are then de-inked. Once they are de-inked, the raw material is pulped with the original pulp from the wood. This creates a continuous loop between production and recycling.

The maps show the changes of an office building between the present and the future.


Overall,it is clear that the office will undergo a number of changes.The most important of which is the the expansion of office rooms,in addition the proposed change will shift the focus of the building to be more oriented.


Regarding outside areas, The left side area used to be a grass yard, but it was then redeveloped into Outdoor seating area in the north-west corner, while south-west became a place to set chairs. In the right side of the building, The meeting area with coffee machine and chairs was constructed, replacing the grass area.


In terms of the main building,The Wcs area is moved to the top of the North-East corner.Additionally,The office places behind Entrance redeveloped as a smaller, from 4 to 2 offices.The north area of the main building also saw a number of changes, with Kitchen being turned into office, and Canteen also being converted into office, except for Storeroom, which stay the same.







The line graph gives information about the USA labour workforce from 1930 to 2010.


Overall, farming, fishing, foresting and other services saw a decline in the percentage of labour force employment, while the opposite trend can be seen for that in the Technical, Industrial, Sales and office fields. Additionally, agricultural fields fell from by far the most popular sector to the least one in the final year of the time period, while the opposite trend was true for the industrial sector.


Regarding industries that gained popularity, in 1930, around 10% of the workforce engaged in sales and office work, while , followed by a  significant decrease to nearly 0% in 1940 and recovered by 20% in 2010.Similar changes, but to a lesser extent can be seen in the figure for the Technical sector, which increased dramatically by nearly 23%.The employment in the Industrial sector  remain unchanged at approximately 5% in the first 3 years.


In terms of sectors that saw their decline in the number of employees, the employment in the farming,fishing and  foresting accounted for nearly 78% of the USA labour force in 1930, while the proportion of  people working in the other services stood at around 15%. The figure for the farming, fishing and foresting sector declined significantly by around 76%, and reached its lowest point at nearly 0%. The figure for the other services field saw a similar change, which increased nearly 10% in 1940 and then declined to the beginning point in 2010.

The given table compares 5 Asian countries in terms of the proportions of four different types of fuel used for electricity generation in 2005.


Overall, it is clear that there were significant differences between energy preferences among five given countries. While South Korea and Japan went for sustainable energy sources, other countries preferred traditional fossil fuels.


Regarding eco-friendly products, South Korea and Japan dominated in terms of nuclear use, with respective figures being 49% and 33%. While 19% and 13% of energy in Malaysia and Singapore was generated from nuclear, Thailand did not use this type of energy. In terms of hydro & wind energy, South Korea made up a major proportion of energy used, at 48%, followed by ThaiLand which stood at 19%.Generally, Other nations have the same data, around 4%.


Cornering fossil fuels, Malaysia and Singapore dominated in terms of coal & lignite use, with respective figures being 61% and 42%, while other nations account for around 3 to 6 percent. As for petroleum sources, it is obvious that Thailand was a nation which consumed petroleum energy most,at 36%, whereas other nations consumed lower, about 2 to 3 percent. In terms of other sources of energy, the percentage of use in 5 distinct countries is approximately equivalent, at?? .









The table compares six cities in terms of the underground railway systems.


Overall, Underground railway systems in London, Paris and Tokyo are the oldest and longest, thereby serving the most passengers annually, while three newly established railways in Washington DC, Kyoto and Los Angeles are
shorter in terms of routes and have significantly fewer travellers.


Regarding the three oldest railway systems, the London railway system was established in 1863 and has the highest => longest kilometres of route-394 km,followed by Paris and Tokyo, in 1900-199 km and 1927-155 km,respectively. However, despite the latest opened railway system and being the shortest one, the railway system in Tokyo serves the most visitors of three, with 1927m passengers per year, compared to 1191m passengers and 775m passengers in Paris and London, respectively.


Concerning the remaining railways networks, the Washington DC railway network was established in 1863 and has the highest kilometres of route-126 km,followed by Los Angeles and Kyoto , in 2001-28 km and 1981-11 km,respectively. The passengers received in letter of these 3 cities were generally lowest, except for Washington DC, at 144m.




Task 2


Nowadays, families are not as close as in the past and a lot of people have become used to this. Why is this happening? Do the advantages of this trend outweigh the drawbacks?


It is proposed that nowadays, family bonds aren't as strong as in the past, and this has become normal. It is caused by economic status and marriage, while some people argue that this is a positive tendency, I strongly believe that its disadvantages surpass any advantages.


WHERE IS YOUR TOPIC SENTENCE? The first motive is that people have to move to a better economic place to earn-living.Many people have disadvantaged backgrounds, they decided to go to cities to have a better salary.Another reason is that people would have married with people who lived far from them. This is mainly because they could keep in touch with others regardless of distance based on the internet,leading to easier to build up strong relationships.


From my perspective, I consider that living far from family is not a good tendency because people could feel lonely when there are no family members behind them and could not receive any support from relatives.For example, a student living far from home might struggle with stress or health problems without the advice of their family, which can negatively affect their well-being and performance.


In conclusion, this trend happened because of economic status and marriage. Despite some benefits this trend would bring, I argue that its drawbacks outweigh any advantages.


OUTLINE:





SHOULD HOLD RESPONSIBILITY:
They have contributed to damaging the environment, So they have to take responsibility.
reason: in terms of the travel industry, many people come from other countries and may be because it's not their nation, so they could throw rubbish,waste in public areas,leading to pollution, because if they damage the environment, they should take responsibility for these actions.
SHOULD NOT HOLD RESPONSIBILITY:
-Not only tourism destroy the environment:
Reason: the local people are also the factors in damaging the ecosystem. So if people blame everything on tourism, it's not fair.


-The authorities do not have a strict rule about tourism, So they do whatever they think is not legal, such as through waste,bottles on the beach.










It is proposed that maintaining conventional libraries is not necessary because technology advancement could alter their functions. From my perspective, I totally disagree with this argument.


On the one hand, it is reasonable for some people to argue that physical libraries are no longer essential. This is based on the assumption that widespread availability of online data-base and e-books have revolutionized the way people access information. Therefore, there would be  a decline in the number of people to physical libraries as they could get access to material from the comfort of their homes, leading to libraries maintained could be wasteful and should be used for other more meaningful purposes. For example, in some cities, especially developed ones, there are countless homeless people on the streets. Instead of building traditional libraries, the authorities could construct accommodation for residents.


On the other hand, physical libraries are thought to be important and should be preserved. First and foremost, libraries could represent historical and cultural values as some libraries keep important historical books, so they have valuable materials.Moreover, physical libraries could provide reliable information. It is obvious that libraries had a purpose to store different kinds of books such as historical books . Even though many revolutions occur, libraries have kept their main purpose to provide visitors with the information they are looking for and be certain of the truth. As Neil Gaiman said that “Google can bring you back 100,000 answers. A librarian can bring you back the right one”.


To recapitulate, although there are rationales to say that conventional libraries are no longer important, it is my stronger belief that it is necessary to maintain traditional libraries as they maintain history, and more importantly, truth and it literally aims for the better long-run betterment.

It is proposed that a majority of people tend to choose to have plastic surgery to improve their appearance.This trend is attributed to two main reasons. Although there are some upsides of this tendency, I contend that their disadvantages outweigh any advantages.


There are two main reasons for this tendency. The primary motivation is internal motivation. Such they could pursue cosmetic procedures for themselves and make them feel happier and more confident. Moreover, plastic surgery could give them competitive advantages over other people in modelling , entertainment. Another reason is external motivation. It could be an unrealistic beauty standard because they may be under the omnipresent pressure of the media.


From my perspective, these regulations represent a progressive development. Firstly, its risks and complications. It is obvious that
cosmetic and plastic surgery have risks and possible complications that may negatively affect a people’s health and all types of surgical procedures, including reconstructive and cosmetic surgery, have risks as cosmetic procedures are a type of surgeon, so they have a risk and complications and have a huge impact on people, in some cases they could die after engaping in plastic surgery.Secondly, this tendency could enhance Unrealistic expectations, because cosmetic procedures are artificial, they cannot always give perfect results. The American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS) states that "a surgical procedure may be able to fix a specific issue, but it cannot make a person look like someone else or reach the level of perfection people may be seeking"


To recapitulate, this tendency is caused by internal and external motivation and although there are some advantages, I strongly believe that this phenomenon is a negative trend.


TASK 1:





The picture illustrates how to purify water using a simple system which turns dirty water into clean water.


It is clear that the process comprises four distinct stages, beginning with pouring dirty water into a plastic barrel, and ending with the drinking water being generated.
At the beginning of the process, the water is poured into a plastic barrel, after the plastic barrel is filled by dirty water, they pass through 3 layers, top filter contains sand, middle filter consists of charcoal and the bottom filter is comprised of gravel, this multiple-stage filtering process effectively cleans the water, making it ready for consumption. Once the dirty water passes through filter layouts, the filter water is transferred to a storage drum through a pipe, this item connects the barrel to the drum, with one end position in the gravel layer. At the end of the process, a tap located at the bottom of the storage drum can be opened to allow water  to be collected for drinking purposes.







The given table compares the number of workers and factories generating silk in terms of England and Wales nations between 1851 and 1901.


Overall, the number of male, female workforces and total employees declined, while the opposite trend can be seen for the factories producing silk .Additionally, The number of male engaged in producing silk was always higher than that of females throughout the given time-frame.


In terms of the number of employees, the figure for Male, Female and total employees saw a significant decline from 1851 to 1901. The figure for Male and Female stood at 53.964 and 76.786 workforces, respectively and declined to the lowest point at 13.375 and 25.567 employees, respectively. It is obvious that total employees are the sum of women and man workers, so if the number of workers in both genders declined, it is clear that the total employees saw a similar change, which declined from 130.750 to 38.942 workers.


Regarding the number of factories generating silk, it is noticeable that the growth of factories was opposite with the workers engaged in, which generally increased from 272 to 623 buildings. especially, in 1861, while the workers were significantly felt, the quantity of factory buildings reached its highest peak, at 761 factories.

Key features: 
- Female: dominant in transport and services sector in both years
- Male: shift from agriculture to transport and services 
- Trend: increase (similarity) -> đều tăng trong lĩnh vực  services + business
- all industries became more gender-balanced by 2003. 




The given table compares male and female workforces  in terms of percentage in six distinct sectors in 1993 and 2003 in New Zealand.


Overall, the percentage of female workers in building, social services, and business show a significant increase, while the opposite trend can be seen for the remaining sectors. Regarding male, the proportion of male engaging in services and transport, business, manufacturing, and social services sectors saw a dramatic increase. Additionally, the female dominated the transport and services sectors in both years, whereas male shifted from agriculture to transport and services. It is noticeable that all industries became more gender-balanced by 2003.


In 1993, the percentage of female workforce accounted for 53% in services and transport sectors, while the counterpart accounted for only 22%. In terms of Agriculture, there is a huge gap between the percentage of male and female workers, about 30 employees. Regarding Business, manufacturing, and building sectors, the gap between male and female workers was not intensive, around 6% to 12%, additionally the percentage of female workers generally higher than that of male, except for manufacturing.


By 2003, the percentage of female workers in services and transport declined to 36%, whereas the male representation rose to 31%. In terms of business, the figure for male and female both increased significantly from 7% to 25% and  1% to 22%, respectively. Regarding Agriculture, male workforces saw a dramatic decline from 38% to 8%. In the remaining sectors, there was => were no significant changes compared to the figures for 1993. ; however, the percentage of male workforces engaging in manufacturing was higher than that of female workers, about 1.5 times.
















Task 2: Some people think that parents have a great influence on their children. Others believe that the media is a bigger influence. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.


While some people say that parents have a huge impact on their children, others argue that the mass media have a greater influence. From my perspective, I totally agree with the latter argument.


On the one hand, it is reasonable for some people to think that parents have a huge impact on their children rather than the media. This is based on the assumption that parents serve as primary role models for children, through raising children, especially in formative years of their children, parents could shape children's bahaviour's patterns as they have a tendency to imitate the behaviours of people  they are surrounded with.For example, in some family which father addict alcohol and tend to hurt his wife and daughter their son may inherit his violence father feature and tend to damaged people surrounding with.


On the other hand, media is thought to bring more impact on children. This is mainly because of the rise of multimedia platforms due to technological advancements,so children nowadays are more exposed to these contents than ever before, leading to shaped children's attitudes and preferences from an early age. For example, watching violence content fosters aggressive tendencies and normalizing antisocial behaviours. This phenomenon was attributed to the youth crime rate. According to recent research, fast-paced programs such as Cocomelon can cause mental issues for children.


To recapitulate, although there are rationales to say that parents have a huge impact on their children , it is my stronger belief that the media have more influence on children as they could shape children's behaviour from an early age.

The picture illustrates how the museum changed between 1998 and 2008.


Overall, it is clear that the museum underwent a number of changes, the most important of which is the rearrangement of all facilities. It is obvious that existing places are reorganised to optimized functionality.


As for amenities, the cafe stayed its position in the bottom centre of the map and a new restaurant was constructed to the left of the cafe, while/ whereas the WC which was relocated from the bottom right corner of the map to the other side of the cafe. There were small changes to the garden located in the center of the map, with new fountains being built and the spaces for cafes being set up. The coatroom used to be Temporary exhibition room in 1996, but it was reconstructed to be a Bags and Coats room in 2008. In the bottom corner, the shop was moved to a more centralized position, adjacent to the coating room.


In terms of the exhibition area, after the modification, the right side was entirely used for the permanent exhibition room, moreover, temporary exhibition room was extended, and relocated from the bottom left corner to a more centered place - to the left of the garden and there were no changes made to the entrance and exit where tickets are sold, which were still at the mid bottom of the museum.

-wealthiness is just one of the factors that make people satisfied.
Reason: satisfaction comes from emotion, so a lot of factors affect people's emotions such as health,relationships.According to world happiness report in 2024, the happiest nation is Finland, however the US with their GPS higher than that in finland stood at 23 ranking.

-people would never be satisfied.
reason: people tend to pursue what kind of thing that interests them, especially technology. new things would become old and used one day. “New one in, old one out”.
Wealthiness contributes to satisfaction, if having any additional economic wealth, it could solidify happiness foundation.
Reason:people tend to pursue things that make them interested or happy and could be bought with money. If they gained it, they would feel satisfaction, happy because of their achievement. According to The German Ideology, Marx and Engels said that “It is not the consciousness of men that determines their being, but, on the contrary, their social being that determines their consciousness.”, in other words, ”Matter determines consciousness.”.

The pie charts illustrate the percentage of graduates with distinct certifications working in a particular engineering company  in 1980 and 2008.


Overall,despite remaining unchanged in the percentage of Master science qualification degrees, the percentage of phd science qualification graduates and phd art was increased, while the opposite trend can be seen for that in first degree art/science and master art. Additionally, the figure for the science sector was generally higher than the art sector in both two years.


In terms of people with science degrees, the proportion of Master-Science employees stood at 29% in 1980 and remained unchanged in 2008, followed by phd-science, which increased from 25% to 30%-make up a highest rate in 2008. Although generally all sectors relating to science were increased, the figure for first-degree science was opposite, which declined by 8%.


As for employees majoring in the Art field, the Master art and  first-degree art saw a tiny degreed in the proportion of graduates, by 1% for both. However, the PhD may have attracted more workers, which increased its proportion from 2 to 7%.












TASK 2:



It is a proposal that if there is a wealthy nation, people's satisfaction would not be affected by an increase of economic wealth. From my perspective, I totally agree with this argument.


On the one hand, it is reasonable for some people to argue that with more money, citizens may become more sastifield. This is based on the assumption that wealthiness contributes to satisfaction, if having any additional economic wealth, it could solidify happiness foundation. This is mainly because people would tend to pursue things that make them interested or happy and could be bought with money. If they gained it, they would feel satisfaction, happiness, and release stress because of their achievement. According to The German Ideology, Marx and Engels said that “It is not the consciousness of men that determines their being, but, on the contrary, their social being that determines their consciousness.”, in other words, ”Matter determines consciousness.”.


On the other hand, increasing the economy is thought to not affect people's satisfaction. First and foremost, wealthiness is just one of the factors that make people satisfied as satisfaction comes from emotion, so a lot of factors affect people's emotions such as health, relationships. According to the world happiness report in 2024, the happiest nation is Finland, however the US with their GPS higher than that in Finland stood at 23 ranking. Additionally, people would never be satisfied. There is no denying that people tend to pursue what kind of thing that interests them, especially technology and new things that would become old and used one day. “New one in, old one out”.




To recapitulate, although there are rationales to say that if there is any addition in economic wealth, people would be more satisfied , it is my stronger belief that this hypothesis would not happen as a person's satisfaction comes from distinct factors, not only wealth.

The pie charts illustrate the distinct energy sources in 2008 and the projected figures in 2030.


Overall, it is predicted that there will be an increase in the percentage of hydro, wind, gas and oil energy sources, while the opposite trend will be seen in coal and other sources. It is obvious that the solar energy source would be eliminated in Australia and will be replaced by a geothermal source. Additionally, the figure for Coal and oil is generally highest in both 2 years.


In 2008, in terms of conventional energy products, coal accounted for the largest  proportion of energy production, at 39% followed by gas at nearly  23%, and oil at 32.5%. Regarding renewable energy sources, wind and solar energy account for less than 0.5% and solar energy makes up 1.3%. The percentage of other energy sources was 3.8%.


By 2030, it is noticeable that solar energy would be discarded and replaced by Geothermal, taking up 4.3%. It is predictable that coal would be the least preferred energy among 3 traditional fossil fuels, standing at about 35.5%. The proportion of gas energy would witness the most significant rise, by approximately 9%, while oil is expected to be the most popular type of energy provider, at 35.5%. Renewable energy sources such as contributed with wind and hydro accounting are expected to account for 0.7% and 1.7%, respectively. Additionally, other sources of energy are projected to decline slightly by nearly 0.2%.





The pie charts compare town A and town B in terms of workforces of particular sectors namely manufacturing, sales and services in 1960 and 2010.


Overall, in both towns, there is a decline in manufacturing employees, while the opposite trend can be seen for remaining sectors, except for Sales in town A which increased. Additionally, in town A, the proportion shifting from sales to manufacturing, whereas in town B, manufacturing was dominant in both 2 years.
In terms of town A, manufacturing workforces accounted for the largest proportion, at 41% and then declined to 20%, followed by sales, which declined from 30% to 16%. Services was seen as a key industry as the proportion in this field increased by 35%.


Regarding town B, it is obvious that despite a decline from 70% to 53%, manufacturing remained the dominant sector among the three sectors. Additionally, Sales workforces took up 22% in 1960 and increased to 22% in 2010. A similar change, but to a greater extent can be seen for the Services sector, which increased by 15%.











Possible 
Impossible 
Reason: nowadays, there are available technologies that reduce pollution from waste produced by factories.
the authorities could implement an industry that damages the environment.
There are many renewable energies which could replace conventional energy sources such as oil, coat. 
For example, Japan, which is one of the most developed countries in the world, has a low rate of pollution as they applied technologies and modern methods to reduce the carbon footprint and waste.


an increase in economics could lead to damage to the environment.
Reason:industrialization
Many nations tend to exploit natural resources on a large scale, leading to deforestation, especially in manufacturing. According to “ iqair.com” ,On June 10, the current PM2.5 in Grand Island in the US was 14.8  times higher than the WHO's given for PM2.5. The Air Quality number (AQI) reached 104 PM which is considered unhealthy.







Some people believe that it is not unrealistic for a nation to balance economic growth and maintain a fresh environment, while others say that it is not possible. From my perspective, I totally agree with the former view.


On the one hand, it is reasonable for some people to argue that it is impossible to both maintain economic growth and a clean environment. It is based on the assumption that an increase in economics could lead to damage to the environment. This is mainly because of industrialization, many nations tend to exploit natural resources on a large scale, leading to deforestation, especially in manufacturing. According to “ iqair.com” ,On June 10, the current PM2.5 in Grand Island in the US was 14.8  times higher than the WHO's given for PM2.5. The Air Quality number (AQI) reached 104 PM which is considered unhealthy.


On the other hand, balancing economic growth and maintaining a clean environment is thought to be possible as nowadays, there are available technologies that reduce pollution from waste produced by factories. There are many renewable energies which could replace conventional energy sources such as oil, coat. Moreover, in order to reduce the damage of factories on the environment, the authorities could implement an industry that damages the environment. For example, Japan, which is one of the most developed countries in the world, has a low rate of pollution as they applied technologies and modern methods to reduce the carbon footprint and waste.


To recapitulate, although there are rationales to say that it is not realistic to be both economically successful and a clean environment, it is my stronger belief that it is possible as a result of the availability of technologies and the actions from the authorities and it literally  aimed for the better long-run betterment.

The line chart illustrates how many enquiries were sent by three different methods namely in person, by letter/email, by telephone in 6 months in 2011.




Overall, the number of in-person and telephone enquiries increased, while the opposite trend can be seen for that for by letter/email enquiries. Moreover, the enquiries made from in-person methods rose significantly,  which turned from the least popular type of enquiries to the most common.


In the first month, the number of telephone requests was approximately 950 enquiries, followed by that of letter/email and in person, at around 780 and 450 enquiries, respectively. From January to March, There was a slight increase in the number of by telephone enquiries,by around 10 enquiries. In contrast, the figure for by email/letter enquiries declined significantly to under 750 enquiries. Additionally, there was a significant increase in the number of in-person enquiries, which surpassed other methods in April.


In the remaining period, the number of in-person and telephone enquiries increased significantly, by around 600 and 400 enquiries respectively, while the opposite trend was true for letter/email enquiries, which declined significantly to the lowest point nearly 400 enquiries in May and remained unchanged in the last month.








should be banned
should not be banned
+ Overuse of smartphones  could harm our health, especially our mental health.
Reason:
-Using mobile phones in public places could cause accidents because of distraction, and it can also lead to eye problems and mental health issues.

+This phenomenon could lead to loss of social interaction.
-Reason: if more and more people were using mobile phones, they would no longer have demand to talk with others,leading to lack of  real exposure => connection among people.

For example, in many families, each member often stays in their own room and spends hours on their phone instead of talking together. This reduces real f2f interaction and weakens family bonds.=> public space??


+Mobile phones are essential tools in today’s technology society.
-In many developed countries, not using mobile phones for a period of time can seriously affect people. For example, some jobs require workers to stay updated all the time, such as journalists or software engineers and MMO.

A complete ban is more or less impossible
Reason: People may secretly use their phones because they are small and portable and humans have an initial temptation to entertainment.
Instead of a ban, the authorities should implement a strict rule about using mobile phones for hours.













Reason:
affected by social.
-isolated from people surrounding them -> difficult for them to reintegrate into society.
- They are often isolated from the people around them, making it difficult to reintegrate into society -> create a cycle of committing crime.


2.The prison system is not good enough
If the prison system could not alter criminals' behaviour, it is clear that when they were released , nothing would change in their mind and they would commit a crime again.


Solutions:


Raise awareness among the public.
Provide social welfare for criminals after their release so they can meet their basic needs.
Strengthen the prison system.





The given chart compares seven distinct nations in terms of the annual pay for doctors and other workers in 2004.


Overall, it is obvious that doctors made more than other workers in all given countries, moreover, the average annual income of doctors and other workers in the US was the highest.


In terms of the US => regarding countries with higher salaries/ best-paid countries, Switzerland and France, the annual pay for doctors was 120 thousand dollars in the US, followed by that in Switzerland and France, at around 75 and 78 thousand dollars the average income of doctors in the US was BY FAR the highest, at 120 thousand US dollars, which nearly doubled that of Switzerland and France, both averaging around 75  thousand US dollars. Regarding  other workers, their incomes in the US were ALSO the highest at?, while other workers in Switzerland and France were generally lower at?.


Regarding remaining nations, the annual pay for doctors in Germany, Czech and Italy was generally equal, at around 60-65 thousand dollars. Similarly, the income of other workers in the three mentioned nations stayed exactly the same, at 20 thousand dollars. Additionally, Finland was the exception among the four referenced countries, where doctors had the lowest income, whereas the other workers had the highest.

Task 2: Some people think most crimes are the result of circumstances like poverty and other social problems. Others believe that they are caused by people who are bad in nature. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.






Some people believe that major crimes are the consequences of circumstances such as poverty and other social issues, while others argue that because of their inherent quality. From my perspective, I agree with the former view.


On the one hand, it is reasonable for some people to argue that they become criminals because they are bad in nature. It is based on the assumption that people possessing bad qualities are more likely to be violent than other people. For example, A person who often tells lies and doesn’t feel guilty for hurting others might later do bad things like stealing, or even hurting someone. In real life, many criminals were found to have shown these bad behaviors before they committed serious crimes.


On the other hand, poverty and social issues are thought to be common key factors to generate crimes. This is mainly because people suffering from lots of difficulties because of being in poor condition could decide to commit serious offenses as if people do not have enough money to meet the basic needs, they would be tempted to become involved in criminal lifestyles just to satisfy their families’ financial needs. Moreover, people who have high frequency exposure to violence would become the same. For example, in many families whose father is addicted to alcohol and tend to hurt his family, his son or daughter could be influenced by aggressive behavioral patterns by their father.


To recapitulate, although there are rationales to say that the majority of criminals are caused by their initial behaviour, it is my stronger belief that poverty and social issues are the main factors of this tendency

Efficiency at work


When people are working with a job that they are passionate about, it could be a huge motivation to the workforces.
Reason:
It is obvious that when people work on something they are passionate about, they tend to be more focused, motivated, and efficient. This motivation is controlled by their personal desires rather than material gains, which leads to higher performance.In many cases, many people lack the motivation to do anything. However, when they are given a task that interests them, it can help them surpass laziness and get to work with enthusiasm.

The given chart compares the world’s top three producers in terms of four distinct  dairy products.


Overall, it is obvious that milk dominated the quantity of dairy needs produced among dairy products, especially in the EU => with EU taking the lead in producing milk and milk powder. Additionally, India was the largest global producer of butter, while China took the lead in producing milk powder.


Regarding milk, leading milk production was the EU, with 142.970 MT, followed by India and the US, at 1270 and 90.038 MT, respectively. As for milk powder, it was most produced by China, at 1.200 MT, surpassing => exceeding NewZealand, at 1.110 MT. Additionally, despite the EU being the top position at milk, it was the lowest ranked => it had the lowest rank in producing milk powder, at only 770 MT.


In terms of Cheese, 7.120 MT of cheese was produced by the EU, followed by the United States with 4,925 MT, while Brazil was far behind with just 700 MT. In contrast,/ Meanwhile,  butter was most produced by India- 4.500 MT, significantly surpassing the EU and the US, about 2 times.

It is a proposal that the private information of many individuals is under control by huge companies and organizations. Although there are some upsides to this tendency, I contend that their disadvantages outweigh any advantages.


On the one hand, this trend is thought to bring about some advantages. One piece of evidence is that the individual’s experiment would increase. This is mainly because if people share their personal data with companies, they would provide goods or information that is suitable for each individual. For example, YouTube, a huge entertainment company, recommends the types of videos that people watch most in the top layer. However, this line of reasoning is not sound because people's information may be exploited for commercial purposes.


On the other hand, this tendency is thought to be disadvantageous. The first weakness is that people's private information may be exploited for commercial aims. Google is a good example for this situation. It is obvious that when people register a Google account, there is always a long 
policy. If people read this, they would deter this agreement, including content that their information would use for commercial purposes. Another shortcoming is that there is a high risk of data leakage. This is based on the fact that the client's information belongs to the companies and was put in their database. If any critical security vulnerability arises, the user's data would face a high risk of theft. For example, in 2020, a serious security vulnerability was detected in the Facebook database, it allowed hackers to get access to user's data without permission. As a result, more than 3 million pieces of client data were leaked.


To recapitulate, although there are rationales to say that this trend brings an advantage, it is my strong belief that the negative aspects of providing private information for huge companies prevail over any given merits, such as the high risk of information theft and the user’s information being used for commercial purposes.




BÀI MẪU 21-22/6


1.More houses are needed in many countries to cope with increasing populations. Would it be better to build houses in existing towns and cities, or to develop new towns in rural areas?


There is a debate whether we should build houses in existing urban areas or create new towns in rural regions. While some people may think more places of residence in cities have a few advantages, I believe new towns in rural areas benefit a nation as a whole.


On the one hand, more buildings have some negative consequences on cities. More apartment units would reduce the price per unit and the renting cost, which will certainly encourage greater numbers of people to migrate to cities. In this way, urban areas have to cope with the greater level of overcrowding, both contributing to increasingly serious traffic congestion and overburdened public services such as healthcare, education. In addition, constructing new buildings requires space which is likely cleared by cutting down trees. This will lessen numbers of trees, which are vital in absorbing rainwater that falls on the grown,
leading to flooding.


On the other hand, the new progress in rural areas is positive. As new towns develop, more companies are opened and the infrastructures are constructed in rural areas. This creates greater employment opportunities, which reduces numbers of people who migrate to cities for economic purposes, and eventually lessens the migration burden on urban areas. A proper investment, which focuses on new areas such as niche manufacturing, tourism rather than traditional agriculture or resource-based businesses, could improve the socio-economy in rural regions. This benefits rural citizens as well as the national economy.


For the reasons mentioned above, it seems to me that new towns constructed in rural areas bring greater positive effects than creating houses in urban areas.


Many buildings are protected by laws because they are part of the nation's history. However, some people think old buildings should be knocked down to make way for new ones because people need houses and offices. How important is it to maintain old buildings? Should history stand in the way of progress?


Some people believe that old buildings should be replaced with apartments and new offices because history might interfere with the progress of the country. However, I strongly believe that it is of great importance to preserve such buildings as they not only represent the national identity but also carry a significant intrinsic value.


On the one hand, there are a number of compelling reasons for protecting old buildings. Firstly, such antique buildings are attached with a great historic value that contributes tremendously to the national historic preservation. Secondly, without them, all the countries around the world would become identical, meaning that people would be assimilated due to the loss of their national identity and connection to their homeland. Finally, some old buildings also have valuable nature in terms of how they are constructed which are worth millions of dollars. For example, some buildings of certain eras, namely pre-World War II, were often built with extremely high-quality materials such as hardwoods from the forests
that are no longer exist.


On the other hand, contradictory to the common belief that history hinders the country’s development, protecting it can actually stimulate the national economic growth. In particular, numerous antique buildings used as tourist sites often bring an enormous income to the country. For instance, the Colosseum in Italy has attracted a vast number of international tourists every year, contributing greatly to its nation’s tourism industry. Consequently, history can accelerate the national progress significantly due to its economic benefits.


In conclusion, it is critical to protecting old buildings because of its tangible and intangible value, and I believe that history is not a deterrent to the country’s success.

The restoration of old buildings in major cities in the world costs numerous governments’ expenditures. This money should be used in new housing and road development. To what extent do you agree and disagree?


In recent years, governments have spent a great capital on solving housing problems and the improvement of the transport system. While I agree that these investments have brought a host of benefits to citizens, I believe that city planners should allocate an acceptable proportion of public expenditure to rehabilitating aged buildings.


There are various reasons why authorities should spend much money on restructuring old buildings. Firstly, it is important to recognize that many architectural styles have characterized cities, countries where they are located. In fact, it is common that a variety of old buildings which have unique and traditional values in architectural patterns have been integral parts, if not symbols of cities, countries. In other words, modern buildings, which only serve the fundamental function of providing shelters, cannot hold a candle to ancient buildings with cultural heritages in them given that they are created by time. As another reason, the existence of old buildings is of profoundly educational purpose. In certain countries/nations, some old buildings, which are not famous for outstanding design features, are well-known for their attachment/identity closely attached to either historical events or religious factors, playing a critical role in education. As witnesses, aged buildings reflect landmarks in the history or religion, which are irreplaceable, should be transmitted through the generations.


On the other hand, these days, the migration to metropolises has gained currency in many nations. Therefore, not only do governments face the need for housing but also deal with transport issues. As a result of the mentioned problems, the demolition of old buildings is reasonable and understandable. Singapore and Hong Kong are telling examples for this. In such countries, providing appropriate apartments and improving transport qualities are the most essential targets. Besides, old buildings which are under the poor condition, low quality and worthless should be knocked down to give spaces to the emergence of new ones with higher safety and greater economic values.


In conclusion, only when old constructions bear special values in terms of culture or history, should governments subsidize to maintain them. Otherwise, the urgent issues as accommodation and transport development should be taken in priority.

Overall, it is clear that Northern Ireland and Wales registered the highest percentage of high quality water. Additionally, there was an improvement in water quality in Northern Ireland and Scotland, while the opposite trend can be seen for that in Wales and England.
Regarding two nations that led in river water quality, the quality of water in Wales stood at nearly 95%, followed by that in Northern Ireland with nearly 85%. Their percentage of high quality water in Wales and Northern Ireland had the same trend until 1988 which increased slightly and reached around 99% and 89%,respectively. However, in the remaining period, the percentage of freshwater in Wales declined, while the opposite trend can be seen for that in Northern Ireland which continues to raise and surpass Wales between 1988 and 2000.

Topic 1. Supermarkets and manufacturers have a responsibility to reduce the amount of packaging. Others believe that it is the consumer’s responsibility to avoid products with packaging. Discuss both views and give your opinion?


Some people argue that Supermarkets and manufacturers have to take a hand in diminishing the quantity of packaging, while others say that it is the client’s responsibility to eliminate packaging products. From my perspective, I totally agree with the latter argument.
On the one hand, it is reasonable for some people to argue that Supermarkets and manufacturers should take responsibility for packaging. It is obvious that Supermarkets can diminish the use of packaging most effectively. In terms of Supermarkets, It is based on the assumption that by refusing to provide free plastic bags, leading to requiring customers to purchase paper bags, if they have to pay just for plastic bags, they presumably ignore its glamour. Regarding manufacturing, they could replace plastic packaging with eco-friendly ones. According to Milo's recent campaign, they completely altered plastic straws to paper ones, and this strategy received a lot of acclaim in Vietnam.
On the other hand, the moral of each individual is thought to be the main factor to address this problem. This is mainly because users give preferences to eco-friendly products, leading to motivating producers to pack their products with sustainable packaging. Moreover, they could contribute to creating a healthy-environment by preparing paper bags before going shopping. This action may be thought to be wasteful as smaills action could not change the big one. However, if the number of people who use paper bags instead of plastic bags is large enough, it could make a huge variable.
To recapitulate, although there are rationales to say that Supermarkets and manufacturers have to take a hand in diminishing the quantity of packaging, it is my strong belief that clients should take their responsibility to eliminate packaging products as their demands affect on whether supermarkets and manufacturing provides plastic packaging and it literally aims for the long-run betterment.






3. Some people think that the range of technology currently available is increasing the gap between rich people and poor people. Others think that it is causing the opposite effect. Discuss both views and give your opinion


Some people argue that the widespread use of technology exacerbates the gap between rich and poor, while others say that it could bridge the gap between rich and poor. From my perspective, I totally agree with the latter argument.
On the one hand, the range of advanced technology is thought to have a negative effect on the gap between rich and poor people. It is based on the assumption that technological devices are only affordable by the rich person. This is based on the fact that technology devices are complex and their meterties are highly costly, so mentioning electronics is often associated with luxury and wealth. For instance, a RTX 5090 GPU costs about 100 million VND.


On the other hand, this phenomenon is thought to bring positive effects. This is mainly because it could enable people to access the internet regardless of wealth gap, they could have more opportunities to gain knowledge without financial and geographical constraints, especially poorer people. Moreover, this tendency also generates more job opportunities, people with limited capital can start small online businesses on platforms such as shopee, Facebook, or TikTok to earn a living. For example, many mothers have started engaging in online businesses during their maternity leave to generate extra income, which maintains the socio-economic status of their family.




To recapitulate, although there are rationales to say that the range of technology currently available is increasing the gap between rich people and poor people, it is my strong belief that this phenomenon is thought to bring positive effects as it allows poor people get access to global knowledge and create more related jobs about technologies phylum and it literally aims for the long-run betterment.








4. Many governments think that economic progress is their most important goal. Some people, however, think that other types of progress are equally important for a country. Discuss both views and give your opinion.


Some officials think that economic growth is the core mission that the nation would put in the priority, while other believe that not only economic progress but also other factors are essential.
